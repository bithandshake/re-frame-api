> "A person had to work hard for it, but a minute of perfection was worth the effort.
   A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection." â€“ Tyler Durden

### Overview

The <strong>re-frame-api</strong> library is an implementation of the Re-Frame
Clojure/ClojureScript framework with some extra features such as metamorphic-events
(which allows you to register and dispatch your events in a freestyle way).

# Usage

### event-vector

Just to clarify what we called as an 'event-vector':

```
[:my-event "My param"]
```

### effects-map

And how an 'effects-map' looks like:

```
{:dispatch-later [{:ms 500 :dispatch [:my-event "My param"]}]}
```

### metamorphic-event

Yeah! The metamorphic stuff! Let's see how the magic works!

The 'metamorphic-event' formula provides you a more flexible way to dispatch Re-Frame events.
You can pass the event to the [`re-frame.api/dispatch`](documentation/cljc/re-frame/API.md#dispatch)
function (or the dispatching side-effects) as an event-vector, an effects-map
or a function that returns another metamorphic-event ooor a function that returns
a function that returns an event-vector (for example).

```
(dispatch [:my-event])
```

```
(dispatch {:dispatch [:my-event]})
```

```
(dispatch (fn [] {:dispatch [:my-event]}))
```

```
(dispatch (fn [] [:my-event]))
```

```
(dispatch (fn [] (fn [] [:my-event])))
```

```
(dispatch (fn [] (println "You can put some side-effects here!")
                 {:dispatch [:my-event]}))

```

And of course you can do this if you want:

```
(dispatch (fn [] {:dispatch {:dispatch-n [{:dispatch-later [{:ms 420 :fx-n [[:my-side-effect]]}]}]}}))
```

### metamorphic-handler

The 'metamorphic-handler' is very similar to the previous formula.
But it allows you to register Re-Frame effect-handlers really flexible.
You can pass not just a handler function but an event-vector or an effects-map to the
`reg-event-fx` function.

```
(reg-event-fx :my-effects [:my-event])
```

```
(reg-event-fx :my-effects {:dispatch [:my-event]})
```

```
(reg-event-fx :my-effects (fn [_ _] [:my-event]))
```

```
(reg-event-fx :my-effects (fn [_ _] {:dispatch [:my-event]}))
```

And yes, it is possible too ...

```
(reg-event-fx :my-effects (fn [_ _] {:dispatch {:dispatch-n [{:dispatch-later [{:ms 420 :dispatch [:my-event]}]}]}}))
```

### dispatch-once

Do you remember the first time when you tried to store the scroll-position
in the Re-Frame database? Yes you do! Your poor CPU was melting down slowly when
it tried to calculate all of your subscriptions at least hundred times per every
second when you scrolled the viewport.

> The Re-Frame calculates the subscriptions every time when the state changes!
  It is part of the magic under the hood.

The solution is very simple. We have to decrease the number of writes in a specific
interval. So you can use the `dispatch-once` function which only fires an event once
in the given interval.

```
(dispatch-once 500 [:my-event])
```

If you call this a million times in every second the function will ignore the
callings except two times per second (500 ms interval).

### dispatch-last

It is quite similar to the previous function but the `dispatch-last` only fires
an event if you stop calling it at least for the given timeout.

```
(dispatch-last 500 [:my-event])
```

If you call this the same way as in the previous sample the function will ignore
all of your callings and only fires the event (once) when you stop calling it
at least for the given timeout.

### dispatch-later

I put some extra magic to the dispatch-later handler too. So you can use not just
the `:dispatch` handler delayed but all of the Re-Frame handlers and any of
your own handlers.

```
{:dispatch-later [{:ms 100 :dispatch [:my-event]}
                  {:ms 200 :dispatch-n [[:my-event] [:your-event]]}
                  {:ms 300 :my-fx nil}
                  {:ms 400 :dispatch-n [[:my-event] {:dispatch-later [{:fx [:my-side-effect] :ms 500}]}]}]}
```

### dispatch-tick

And what about the event-delaying based on not the time? What if you want to add
just a little slip into the event queue? When you composing your effect-events,
sometimes you face with the fact that the Re-Frame uses a very logical but strict
event queue.
So you can delay your events in the queue easily with the `:dispatch-tick` handler.

```
(reg-event-fx :init-app! [:import-data!])
(reg-event-fx :import-data! ...)

(reg-event-fx :render-app! [:render-surface!])
(reg-event-fx :render-surface! ...)

(reg-event-fx :boot-app! {:dispatch-n [[:init-app!]
                                       [:render-app!]]})
```

When you dispatch the `[:boot-app!]` event in the example above the queue will
look like this:

`[:boot-app!]`
`[:init-app!]`
`[:render-app!]`
`[:import-data!]`
`[:render-surface!]`

If you want the `[:import-data!]` to happens before the rendering started, you
need to add a slippage. So let's try again with the `:dispatch-tick` handler!

```
(reg-event-fx :init-app! [:import-data!])
(reg-event-fx :import-data! ...)

(reg-event-fx :render-app! [:render-surface!])
(reg-event-fx :render-surface! ...)

(reg-event-fx :boot-app! {:dispatch-tick [{:tick 0 :dispatch [:init-app!]}
                                          {:tick 1 :dispatch [:render-app!]}]})
```

Now the `[:import-data!]` event happens before the rendering started and the
queue is ordered in the way we wanted:

`[:boot-app!]`
`[:init-app!]`
`[:import-data!]`
`[:render-app!]`
`[:render-surface!]`

### r function

The `r` function helps you not to care about the event-id when you stacking handler functions.

Case 1: If you disregard the event-id parameter:

```
(defn store-data!
  [db [_ data]]
  (assoc db :my-data data))

(defn import-data!
  [db _]
  (store-data! db [nil 420]))
```

Case 2: If you pass the event-id parameter:

```
(defn store-data!
  [db [_ data]]
  (assoc db :my-data data))

(defn import-data!
  [db [event-id]]
  (store-data! db [event-id 420]))
```

Case 3: If you use the `r` function:

```
(defn store-data!
  [db [_ data]]
  (assoc db :my-data data))

(defn import-data!
  [db _]
  (r store-data! db 420))
```

You can apply functions with `r` one after another if you use the as-> function:

```
(defn store-data!
  [db [_ data]]
  (assoc db :my-data data))

(defn update-data!
  [db _]
 (update db :my-data inc))

(defn import-data!
  [db _]
  (as-> db % (r store-data!  % 420)
             (r update-data! %)))
```

And you can pass more than one parameter by using the `r`:

```
(defn add-user!
  [db [_ name age]]
  (assoc db :my-user {:name name :age age}))

(defn init-app!
  [db _]
  (r add-user! db "John" 42))
```

### Stacking handler functions

Stacking handler functions helps you to decrease the Re-Frame database writes.

In the following example, when you dispatch the `[:handle-data!]` event it followed
by two db writes by the `[:store-data!]` and `[:update-data!]` events.

```
(reg-event-db
  :store-data!  
  (fn [db [_ data]] (assoc db :my-data data)))

(reg-event-db
  :update-data!
  (fn [db _] (update db :my-data inc)))

(reg-event-fx
  :handle-data!
  (fn [_ _] {:dispatch-n [[:store-data! 420]
                          [:update-data!]]}))
```

If you want to do the same thing with only one db write you have several choices:

Case 1: Keep the `[:handle-data!]` event as an effect event and use the `:db`
handler to stack the `store-data!` and `update-data!` functions which were anonymous
functions in the previous example and now they are named functions.

```
; Defining the 'store-data!' handler as a named function:
(defn store-data!
  [db [_ data]]
  (assoc  db :my-data data))

(reg-event-db :store-data! store-data!)  


; Defining the 'update-data!' handler as a named function:
(defn update-data!
  [db _]
  (update db :my-data inc))

(reg-event-db :update-data! update-data!)


(reg-event-fx
  :handle-data!
  (fn [_ _] {:db (as-> db % (r store-data!  % 420)
                            (r update-data! %))}))
```

Case 2: The key is the same as in the previous example the only difference is
that the `handle-data!` function is not an effect event anymore.

```
; Defining the 'store-data!' handler as a named function:
(defn store-data!
  [db [_ data]]
  (assoc  db :my-data data))

(reg-event-db :store-data! store-data!)


; Defining the 'update-data!' handler as a named function:
(defn update-data!
  [db _]
  (update db :my-data inc))

(reg-event-db :update-data! update-data!)


; Defining the 'handle-data!' handler as a named function:
(defn handle-data!
  [db _]
  (as-> db % (r store-data!  % 420)
             (r update-data! %)))

(reg-event-db :handle-data! handle-data!)
```

### How to use subscription handlers in effect events and db events?

If you are register named functions as subscription handlers, you can easily
apply them in effect events and db events.

```
; Defining the 'get-data' handler as a named function:
(defn get-data
  [db _]
  (get db :my-data))

(reg-sub :get-data get-data)


; Defining the 'check-data!' handler as a named function:
(defn check-data!
  [db _]
  (let [my-data (r get-data db)]))
       (assoc db :my-data-valid? (number? my-data))

(reg-event-db :check-data! check-data!)
```

```
; Defining the 'get-data' handler as a named function:
(defn get-data
  [db _]
  (get db :my-data))

(reg-sub :get-data get-data)


(reg-event-fx
  :check-data!
  (fn [_ _]
      (let [my-data (r get-data db)])
           (println my-data))
```

### How to use the debug interceptor?

By using the `re-frame.api/debug!` interceptor your event will be printed to
the console when it get dispatched.

```
(reg-event-db
  :my-event
  [debug!]
  (fn [db _] ...))

(reg-event-fx
  :my-event
  [debug!]
  (fn [cofx _] ...))
```

### How to use the debug mode?

You can turns on/off the debug mode by using the following functions:

```
(ns my-namespace
    (:require [re-frame.api]))

(re-frame.api/set-debug-mode!)
(re-frame.api/quit-debug-mode!)
(re-frame.api/toggle-debug-mode!)
```

In debug mode, the event handler prints all the dispatched events and
their parameters to the console, and you can track what happens under the hood.
